# surface

My personal theme for Counter-Strike: Source. Designed for usage on surf and bunnyhop servers with timers. Heavily borrows from toxichud, h0lmgui and [lody's surface](https://github.com/lodyb/surface) HUD.

## Usage
Extract to `common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike` directory.

To uninstall, remove `surface` from the `cstrike\custom` directory.

## Requirements
- [Terminus font](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/)
